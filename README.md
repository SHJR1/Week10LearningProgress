## Progress

**7/27/22 - Wednesday**

I am currently 60% done with the course. I skipped some of the stuff I know is the same as Javascript since I have some experience in Java and to save time. I am working on the ["String Methods"](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/lessons/java-string-methods/exercises/introduction-to-strings) portion of the course.
