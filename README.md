## Progress

**7/27/22 - Wednesday**

- I am currently 60% done with the course. I skipped some of the stuff I know is the same as Javascript since I have some experience in Java and to save time. I am working on the ["String Methods"](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/lessons/java-string-methods/exercises/introduction-to-strings) portion of the course.

**7/28/22 - Thursday**

- I switched to the Vert.x course and I am following along with the video playlist.
- Ran into an issue with maven on intellij but we got it figured out by the end of the day.

**7/29/22 - Friday**

- About 75% done with the Vert.x course
- Ran into an issue with connecting to a database.
